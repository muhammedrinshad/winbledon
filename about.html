      <h3 class="about-title reveal">Croquet</h3>
      <div class="reveal">
       <p   class="about-p-align">The All England Croquet Club was founded in July 1868 but being without a ground, the Club Croquet Championships were held at Crystal Palace in 1869. Late that year the Worple Road ground was secured and formally opened in 1870.</p> <p  class="about-p-align">When in 1877 the inaugural Lawn Tennis Championship was held, the title of the Club was amended to The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club. Gradually, interest in croquet declined and by the end of 1882 participation had ceased and Croquet was removed from the Club's title. During 1896 the croquet players were invited to return. In 1899 the Club Championship was reinstated and Croquet was restored to the Club's title, However, the upsurge in interest did not last long and after the 1904 Championship the game faded again, although the Club retained the same title.</p> <p  class="about-p-align">Croquet was not provided for when the Club moved to its present Church Road ground, and was first played on 7 September 1953 when a match was arranged with the Croquet Association to mark Coronation Year.</p> <p  class="about-p-align">From 1957 to 2007, the croquet lawn (not full-size) was situated at the southern end of the Grounds, alongside the Church Road boundary fence. The Club Croquet Championship was reintroduced together with a Handicap singles event in 1960 and in recent years a golf croquet event was started. In the autumn of 2007 a new full-size lawn was created in the Southlands College ground, which was opened on 19 April 2008 by Professor Bernard Neal, President of the Croquet Association. Professor Neal was the Club champion 38 times between 1963 and 2005. David Godfree has acted as Hon. Secretary for the Croquet section since 1975.</p>

<h3 class="about-title reveal">Grounds</h3>
<div class="reveal">
  <p  class="about-p-align">The Grounds are owned by The All England Lawn Tennis Ground Plc and consist of both the main site on Church Road, Wimbledon, and the All England Community Sports Ground (AECSG) in Raynes Park.</p>
   <p  class="about-p-align">The main site comprises a total of 18 Championship Grass Courts (including Centre Court and No. 1 Court) and 14 Grass Practice Courts located in Aorangi Park. A further 6 Grass Practice Courts are available during The Championships which are located temporarily on our three Croquet Lawns to the North end of the site. There are also currently six American clay courts and two acrylic courts located in the Southern Apex of the Grounds. As a result of the ongoing Somerset Road project, a further 6 indoor acrylic courts and 6 outdoor American clay courts will be opened towards the end of 2021.</p>
    <p  class="about-p-align">In addition, the AECSG (a 20 acre site acquired by the AELTC in 1990) provides further opportunity for grass court practice with 16 grass courts available alongside 6 indoor acrylic courts and 3 outdoor acrylic courts.</p>
     <p  class="about-p-align">Apart from the grass courts, the courts are used all year round by the Club members and LTA-sponsored players. The grass courts are in play from May to September (except Centre Court and other Show Courts which are used only for The Championships). The courts are lent to a number of clubs and organisations, mainly of a national character, for the staging of various events.</p>
     <p  class="about-p-align">The area north of the Centre Court became known as Aorangi Park after the Club purchased the 11 acres from John Barker Ltd. of Kensington in 1967 and subsequently granted a lease to the New Zealand Sports and Social Club. Aorangi, meaning 'Cloud in the Sky', is the Maori name for Mount Cook.</p>
